This tool will help you to explore the \*.vram files from the game Dragon Ball Raging Blast 2. 

Also, you can export and import the textures into those files.

Credits to the Raging Blast Modding community and specially to revelation from [XeNTaX](https://forum.xentax.com) forum who made the compress/uncompress tool.
