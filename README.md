This tool will help you to explore the \*.vram files from the game Dragon Ball Raging Blast, Dragon Ball Raging Blast 2 and Dragon Ball Z Ultimate Tenkaichi. 

Also, you can export and import the textures into those files.

Credits to the Raging Blast Modding community and specially to revelation from [XeNTaX](https://forum.xentax.com) forum who made the compress/uncompress tool.
